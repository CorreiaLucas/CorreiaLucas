### Hello 👋

My name is Lucas Correia, i'm currently studying IT at Polytech Lyon, a french engineering school. 

### What I Like

⚡ I'm excited about new technologies and video games, even if lately, I didn't really have time to play

😄 I enjoy developping small projects but I'm willing to be part of a bigger one.

### What I'm doing

🔭 I’m currently working on a video game using unreal Engine for the first time.

🤔 I’m looking for an internship in the IT sector

🌱 Most of my projects are not on GitHub, but I should definitely commit them here.
