### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Correia, i'm currently studying IT at Polytech Lyon, a french engineering school. 

### What I Like

âš¡ I'm excited about new technologies and video games, even if lately, I didn't really have time to play

ðŸ˜„ I enjoy developping small projects but I'm willing to be part of a bigger one.

### What I'm doing

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video game using unreal Engine for the first time.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for an internship in the IT sector

ðŸŒ± Most of my projects are not on GitHub, but I should definitely commit them here.
